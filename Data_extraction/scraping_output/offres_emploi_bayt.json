Congratulations John, Joe and Thomas!\n\nAbout Us\n\nLILT is the leading AI solution for enterprise translations. Our stack made up of our Contextual AI Engine, Connector APIs, and Human Adaptive Feedback enables global organizations to adopt a true AI translation strategy, focusing on business outcomes instead of outputs. With LILT, innovative, category-defining organizations like Intel, ASICS, WalkMe, and Canva are using AI technology to deliver multilingual, digital customer experiences at scale.\n\nWhile our core AI technology might share similarities with ChatGPT and Google Translate, it's what we do with it that makes LILT truly revolutionary. Our patented Contextual AI Engine goes beyond basic translations, understanding the nuance of our customer's content and target audience to deliver hyper-accurate, business-focused results. Our connector-first approach seamlessly integrates with our customer's existing workflows, and our human-adapted feedback loop ensures continuous improvement, making LILT a constantly evolving AI partner for your global ambitions.\n\nAuthorization to work in the U.S. is a precondition of employment.\n\nThe Engineering Team at LILT\n\nLILT is a high-performance, large-scale language translation system. We invest in and prioritize workflow (i.e., usability and interface design) and backend AI systems. Since the translation workforce is distributed worldwide, there are interesting cloud engineering problems to solve. We have a strong preference for building our own backend technology, so you’ll be implementing and working with the latest natural language processing (NLP) techniques and ideas.\n\nWhere You’ll Work\n\nThis position can be based out of our Emeryville, CA or Indianapolis, IN offices and will be expected to work in the office in a hybrid capacity.

As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – LILT. \n\nAt its core, LILT has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.\n\nBenefits:\n\nCompensation: At market salary, meaningful equity, 401(k) matching, and flexible time off plus company holidays\n\nMedical Benefits: Employees receive coverage of medical, dental, and vision insurance, plus FSA/DFSA, HSA, and Commuter benefits.
